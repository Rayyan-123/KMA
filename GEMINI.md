Project Goal:
 Recreate the layout and structure of the website at https://atamartialarts.com for the "Karachi Martial Arts Center." The new site should be fully functional, responsive, and use the branding guidelines.
Tech Stack: 
Use standard web technologies: HTML5, CSS3 (preferably with a modern framework like Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., forms, navigation menus).
Design & Branding:
Color Scheme: The primary color should be a shade of blue (#0000FF or a similar vibrant blue), with white used for backgrounds and text contrast.
Logo: 
Use the provided "Karachi Martial Art Center" logo file.
Typography/Style: 
The layout should mimic the structure of the reference site, but adapt the font choices to match the new blue and white theme while remaining professional and easy to read.
Core Features & Content: 
The website should include the following pages and features:
Home Page: A compelling landing page with a hero section, an introduction to the center, and a call-to-action button for a free trial.
Programs/Classes: 
A section detailing different martial arts programs offered (e.g., Kids, Adults, Taekwondo).
Schedule: 
A clear, easy-to-read class schedule table.
About Us: 
Information about the center's history and instructors.
Contact Us: 
A contact form, location map, and contact details matching the logo information.
Forms: 
All links and forms should be functional, even if they initially point to placeholder pages or email submission endpoints
